# PollingServer

In this project, we present the implementation of Rate Monotonic Scheduling algorithm with integrated Polling Server to service aperiodic job requests using open source FreeRTOS platform. This report will present the details of the approach for implementation of Rate Monotonic Scheduling algorithm along with integrated Polling Server. Project report also encloses the complete analysis of both algorithms from performance standpoint. For the implementation and analysis part of the project, Arduino Mega 2560 hardware is used to run, debug and verify the algorithms.
